# 📊 Bank Customer Churn Analysis (SQL · Python · Tableau)

---

## 📝 Introduction
Customer churn is a critical challenge for banks, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.  
This project analyzes bank customer churn to uncover **key drivers, segment high-risk groups, and recommend data-driven strategies** to improve retention.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement
The bank is experiencing customer attrition, leading to loss of revenue and growth opportunities. The goal is to **understand why customers churn, identify at-risk customers, and deliver insights** that support proactive retention strategies.

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values and outliers  
   - Standardized column names and data formats  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of churn vs non-churn customers  
   - Feature correlation analysis (tenure, balance, product usage)  

3. **SQL Analysis**  
   - Segmentation by age, geography, account balance, and churn  
   - KPI tracking: churn rate, revenue impact, high-risk segments  

4. **Python Analysis**  
   - Data preprocessing & EDA visualizations  
   - Statistical insights on churn drivers  

5. **Tableau Dashboard**  
   - Interactive visualizations for churn segmentation  
   - KPIs: churn % by geography, account balance impact, tenure analysis  
   - Storyboard for stakeholder communication  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Customers with **low tenure and low account balance** are more likely to churn  
- Certain **geographies show higher churn rates**  
- Customers with **fewer banking products** are at higher risk  

---

## 💡 Business Impact
By identifying churn drivers and at-risk groups, this analysis enables the bank to:
- Launch **targeted retention campaigns**  
- Improve **product bundling strategies**  
- Focus **customer service efforts** on vulnerable segments  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** → Data extraction & segmentation  
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) → EDA & visualization  
- **Tableau** → Interactive dashboard & storytelling  

---

## 📌 Deliverables
- ✅ SQL queries for churn segmentation  
- ✅ Python Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) with EDA  
- ✅ Tableau Dashboard (with interactive link & preview)  
- ✅ Final insights & recommendations report

## ⭐ Why This Project Stands Out
- 🎯 **End-to-end pipeline** → SQL (segmentation), Python (EDA), Tableau (dashboard)  
- 📊 **Business storytelling** → insights aligned with **real-world banking challenges**  
- 🧑‍💻 **Industry-ready skills** → matches expectations for **Data Analyst / Data Scientist roles at top firms (FAANG, fintech, consulting)**
